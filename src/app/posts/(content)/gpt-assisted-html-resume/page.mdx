My resume is written with vanilla HTML and CSS and compiled to PDF using headless chrome ([web version](https://resume.johncs.com), [PDF version](https://resume.johncs.com/resume.pdf)). The [repo is on GitHub](https://github.com/itsjohncs/resume).

The design and build are fun to hack on but writing is still hard so I wrote a script that helps me iterate on it quickly with GPT-4o. It extracts the body of my resume, sends it to OpenAI alongside my prompt, and prints out the feedback.

Here's an example of some feedback it's given me:

> # Under the job Primer Learning
>
>     Built Unity editor extensions and physics simulations for Primer Learning's popular YouTube channel.
>
>     Clarity Issue: "Popular" is subjective. Consider providing a specific metric (e.g., "Primer Learning's YouTube channel with over X million views/subscribers").

# The Script

I wrote the script in Bash ([source](https://github.com/itsjohncs/resume/blob/main/scripts/wording-check.sh)) but there's [a number of libraries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) you can use to call out to OpenAI's API in various languages.

I'll go through a few lines of the script so you can get a sense of what it does…

In [the system prompt](https://github.com/itsjohncs/resume/blob/main/scripts/openai/broad-prompt.md?plain=1) I tell the model to expect the resume as the only input from the user. This means creating the request can be done completely by the handy JSON manipulation tool [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/):

```bash
OPEN_AI_REQUEST_BODY=$(jq -n \
    --argjson temperature "$TEMPERATURE" \
    --arg prompt "$PROMPT" \
    --arg html "$ADJUSTED_HTML_CONTENT" \
    '{
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": $prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": $html}
      ],
      "temperature": $temperature
    }')
```

Extracting the response can also be done with `jq`.

```bash
RESPONSE=$(curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPEN_AI_RESUME_PROJECT_KEY" \
    -d "$OPEN_AI_REQUEST_BODY" \
    --no-progress-meter)

RESPONSE_CONTENT=$(jq --raw-output .choices[0].message.content <<< "$RESPONSE")
```

Finally I pretty-print the response to the terminal using [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow).

```bash
glow <<< "$RESPONSE_CONTENT"
```

`glow` makes ChatGPT's output a little more readable (and more visually interesting).

If your resume exists in a textual format (ex: LaTeX, Typst, or JSON) you could set up a similar script very quickly. Even if your resume is stuck in Word or a similar tool, you can probably convert it to text in a script to pass to ChatGPT.

This script helped me work through quite a bit of awkward wording but I'm not sure how effective it's really been yet. Hopefully I'll have a follow-up post soon about how GPT helped me find a good role.

If you have real-human feedback for my resume, please reach out! My email and socials are on [the frontpage of this site](/).
