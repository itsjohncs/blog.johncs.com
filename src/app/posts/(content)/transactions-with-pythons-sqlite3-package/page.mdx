Python's `sqlite3` package tries to take care of the tricky business of properly executing `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements. The rules of when and how this automatic transactioning is done has confounded a number of developers, many of whom have jumped ship and chosen to use the [aspw](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw) package or similar.

For one reason or another I needed to use the standard libary's package for a project, so I jumped into CPython's internals to take a look at exactly how it behaves (I was specifically looking at Python 2.7's most recent code). The results are mostly ordinary with some occasional gotchas.

## Rules for Automatic Transactions

By automatic transactions here I am not referring to SQLite's built-in behavior of wrapping data-changing operations in transactions. Rather, I am speaking of the Python module's special behavior where it actually executes `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements on your behalf.

A transaction is automatically started (ie: a `BEGIN` is executed) when all of the following conditions are met:

1. The `isolation_level` is not `None`. [^1]
2. The Connection object thinks a transaction has not already been started.
3. An `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, or `REPLACE` statement is being executed. [^2]

The `BEGIN` statement will be concatenated with whatever value is in `isolation_level`. For example, if `isolation_level` was equal to `DEFERRED`, the statement executed when the above conditions are met is `BEGIN DEFERRED`.

A transaction is automatically ended (ie: a `COMMIT` is executed) when all of the following conditions are met:

1. The `isolation_level` is not `None`. [^1]
2. The Connection object thinks a transaction has already been started.
3. Any statement that is not an `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE`, or `SELECT` is being executed. [^2]

The [`sqlite3.Connection.commit()`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.commit) function will also send a `COMMIT` statement as long as the Connection object thinks a transaction has already been started.

## How the Connection Object Detects Transactions

When the module checks to see if a transaction is in progress, it inspects the Connection's `inTransaction` data member (which is not available from Python). This is fine and well if you're only using automatic transactions, but the module can get confused if you ever execute a `BEGIN` statement yourself: If the version of SQLite CPython was linked with is older than 3.2.2, [^3] and you've started a transaction manually by executing a `BEGIN` statement yourself, the `inTransaction` data member may have an incorrect value.

As a rule of thumb, I would advise never executing a `BEGIN` statement manually unless you never use the `sqlite3.Connection.commit()` function and you've set the `isolation_level` to `None`.

[^1]: The [`pysqlite_connection_set_isolation_level()`](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d37f963394aa/Modules/_sqlite/connection.c#l1129) function will set the connection object's `begin_statement` member to NULL if the `isolation_level` is set to `None`. Inside of the [`_pysqlite_query_execute()`](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d37f963394aa/Modules/_sqlite/cursor.c#l441) function `begin_statement` is then checked and a transaction will not be started or ended unless it is non-null.

[^2]: The [`_pysqlite_query_execute()`](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d37f963394aa/Modules/_sqlite/cursor.c#l441) function is responsible for executing all of the statements that are given to the module and it only starts a transaction (by calling `_pysqlite_connection_begin()`) if the statement is one of the types mentioned.

[^3]: In [`_pysqlite_query_execute()`](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d37f963394aa/Modules/_sqlite/cursor.c#l441) there is a [preprocessor conditional](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d37f963394aa/Modules/_sqlite/cursor.c#l752) that conditionally enables the check, and as far as I could tell there is no explicit check to see if the user ever sends a `BEGIN` themselves.
