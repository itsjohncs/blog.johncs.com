If an interviewer asked me to find the last item in a linked list, I might write some code like this:

```python
def get_last(node):
    while node is not None:
        node = node.next
    return node
```

But I'd find that my code doesn't do what I want it to, and my interviewer could probably whip up a formal proof of that shortly after I wrote the second line. This is because my loop condition is `node is not None`, so my "termination condition" (ie: the thing that will absolutely be true immediately after we exit the loop) is `node is None`.

I'm guaranteed to always return `None`!

This is (perhaps) a silly example. But the general technique of thinking about the termination condition I want when writing a loop condition is constantly useful to me.

This is the shortest post I've ever written... I'm nervous about just ending it abruptly ðŸ˜….

Bye for now!
