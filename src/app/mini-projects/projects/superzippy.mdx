I want to distribute some command line scripts to instructors using [Galah](https://github.com/ucrcsedept/galah). They're all on Unixy systems so I can trust that they have Python installed but I've had trouble giving them instructions involving `pip` before.

Interestingly if you say `python file.zip` Python will try and execute the `__main__.py` file in the zip archive. **And** since the ZIP format places all of its metadata at the end of the file, rather than the start, I can even add a `#!/usr/bin/env python\n` to the archive and the zip file becomes executable like a normal binary!

Doing it by hand isn't too hard, but to make the process even easier I've created `superzippy`! It handles it all for me.
