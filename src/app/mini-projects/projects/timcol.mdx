Back when I was doing contract work in the late 00s/early 10s I used a little DOS Batch script I made to track my hours. It worked really well and I loved using it!

I recently started doing some Unity work for my friend at [Primer Learning](https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimerLearning) and I wanted a similar time tracker. So I made a little utility: `timcol`! The name is a shortening of "time collection".

Unlike my previous tool, this one can make invoices and even takes screenshots of my screen so that if I forget to stop it manually I can go back through the screenshots and figure out when I stopped working.
