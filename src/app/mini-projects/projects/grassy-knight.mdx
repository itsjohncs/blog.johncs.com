The [YouTuber Skurry](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYX2-exnYmc6gDObfooTGZg) wanted to make a speed run of Hollow Knight where they cut every piece of grass in the game as quickly as possible. Since grass will grow back as soon as you leave and re-enter a level, determining whether they've succeeded at the end of the challenge was going to be very hard.

So I made them a little mod that adds some counters to the top left of the screen!

It was a very fun project and [their final video is great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADM8BWe6buA).
