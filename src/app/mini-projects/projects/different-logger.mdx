I wanted Python's logging library to give me pretty output and highlight the substituted values. So I made a little library that'd make it do all those things! Here's some output:

<img
    src="/images/different-logger-messages.png"
    alt="Various log messages printed by the logger."
/>

<img
    src="/images/different-logger-exception.png"
    alt="A log message with a stack trace printed by the logger."
/>

You don't need to do anything special to use it, just use the Python `logging` library like normal (ex: `logging.error("%s foobars received, expected 17", num_foobars)`).
