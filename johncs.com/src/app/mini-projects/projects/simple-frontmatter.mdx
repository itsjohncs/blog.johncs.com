I wonder how many people have implemented a simple frontmatter parser... Judging by the volume of static site generators out there I bet there's a bunch.

I made one for [Phial](https://github.com/itsjohncs/phial) that was totally over-engineered awhile ago, but then for the [KA Engineering blog](http://engineering.khanacademy.org) and [this site](http://johncs.com) I went with a simpler version. I doubt it'd be useful, but just in case I figured I should release it under the UNLICENSE.

Here's a document that the parser could handle:

```
# post.rst
title: The best post ever
author: John
...

This really is the best post ever
=================================

I assure you.
```

And here's some code that uses the parser:

```python
>>> import simple_frontmatter
>>> with open("post.rst") as f:
...     frontmatter, contents = simple_frontmatter.load(f)
...
>>> frontmatter
{'title': 'The best post ever', 'author': 'John'}
>>> contents
'\nThis really is the best post ever\n=================================\n\nI assure you.\n'
```
