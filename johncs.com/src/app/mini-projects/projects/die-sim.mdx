Ever play D&D, realize you forgot your dice, and decide to write up a script to roll dice for you? Me too! I made it in Python and didn't spend a ton of time adding features, so its understanding of dice-rolling syntax (like `2d10+8`) is pretty minimal, but it works great!

My initial version of this program had an off by one error which prevented me from ever getting a 20 when rolling a d20! I was upset.
