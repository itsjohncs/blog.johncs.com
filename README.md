# johncs.com

This repository hosts the code for my personal website at [johncs.com](https://johncs.com).

## History

I used to have two separate websites: `johncs.com` and `blog.johncs.com`. This repository originally housed the code for `blog.johncs.com`. In July 2024, I combined both websites into a single site under `johncs.com`. The old `johncs.com` repository can be found [here](https://github.com/itsjohncs/johncs.com-old).

## Technology Stack

The site is a single Next.js app hosted on Vercel.

The first version of the blog was a static site built using bespoke static site generation scripts. Despite various updates and improvements over the years, the styling has remained pretty consistent since its inception.
